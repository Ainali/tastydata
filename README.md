#tastydata

This tool was used to create and display 30+ menues used in the food festival in Stockholm in June 2015. Now it is used to create menues for Wikimania 2019.

The menues are using qlabel (https://github.com/googleknowledge/qlabel/) for getting translations for concepts from Wikidata and Universal Language Selector.

Translations were promoted through the Wikidata Menu Challenge. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Menu_Challenge/Wikimania 2019

Layout and design was primarilly done by MidasN in [MidasN/WikimediaTastydata](https://github.com/MidasN/WikimediaTastydata)
