## Description
Tastydata is a tool to show several menues where the localisation is done by connecting each ingredient to the item about it in Wikidata. It could be used for conferences where the audience is expected to be highly multilingual and manual localisation would not be feasible. 

## Background
Denny Vrandecic started a proof of concept. This tool was [adapted by](https://github.com/Wikimedia-Sverige/tastydata) Wikimedia Sverige and used to create and display 30+ menues used in the food festival in Stockholm in June 2015. This is a fork used to create menues for Wikimania 2019.

Translations were promoted through the [Wikidata Menu Challenge](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Menu_Challenge/Wikimania_2019).

## Dependencies
The menues are using [qlabel](https://github.com/googleknowledge/qlabel/) for getting translations for concepts from Wikidata and [Universal Language Selector](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Universal_Language_Selector).

## How to use the menu
Go to http://aina.li/menu and click on a meal to see the menu for that meal. Chang language with the language selector. Click on an ingredient to see an image of it.

## Adding data and generating menues
Is explained in [this readme](/generator/README.md).
